# PACRR Neural Net Retrieval
Our code is divided into two parts, the first is our simple classifier, the Lucene classifier found in the "_Lucene_" folder.
The second is our python implementation of PACRR. This is found inside the "_PACRR_" folder.

Documnetation for each part can be found in each part's folder.
